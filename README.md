# Mini-Garage
The project implements the following: a special place has a special type of a garage; a man is responsible for opening a gate whenever he sees a car, once the car enters after the gate opens, the monitor increases the number of entering cars by 1.

Process:
1) Initially, the number of cars is zero.
2) A button simulates the man who opens the gate.
3) A sensor detects that the car has passed the gate.
4) Upon detection of the car passing the gate, the gate returns to its initial position using a DC motor.
5) The number of cars is displayed on the 7 SEGMENT DISPLAY.
6) The gatekeeper can choose to use the reset button at any time to reset the button count.


**Usage**
